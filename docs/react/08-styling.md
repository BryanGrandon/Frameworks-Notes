# Styling

In modern React, there are many ways to style a React application with CSS.

### _[CSS inline](/react/styles/inline-css.jsx)_

React lets you add CSS inline, written as attributes and passed to elements.

### _[CSS modules](/react/styles/module/)_

React allows you to add CSS modules to be available within the component in which they are used because they have a local scope by default.
